This time I'm going to write a mobile app about a store using React Native.

There are several features that I need to achieve:

 - Redux.
 - Unit tests.
 - Shopping cart.
 - Recursive Categories/Product list. This is kinda special because I have to read some depth nested structure, but there is not a specific depth level.
 - Java module: Native modules implementation.

The main structure, or at least an initial one is describe by the graphic below:

In order to get a better idea about how the app will looks like, I drawn some mockups:

There are 4 views, at least in the first iteration. I decided to divide like that because for the initial requirement is enough.
